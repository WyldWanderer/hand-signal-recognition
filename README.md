**Hand Gesture Recognition**

This is a boilderplate code repo used to create different geature recognition programs from. You can add different gestures to the `recognize_gesture` function by computing the distance or angles of the hand on screen (lines 32-37 have a couple examples already set up). 

Once your gestures are set up, you can add different triggers in the `trigger_action` function. There is an example that opens a Google Chrome window when a fist is recognized and can be built off of or changed to trigger whatever process or action you would want. 

Yes this will take some tinkering and custom coding but should provide the foundation to build processes that incorporate computer vision elements to help with automating workflows or other tasks.
